<h5>Set Your Price</h5>
<p>What does that mean? That means you can set your own price. Want something small yet still beautiful, set it for the minimum. Thinking you would like to make it a little bigger, little fuller, little prettier, add a few more dollars. Wants something really big and extravagant, set your price higher. You set the price to match the occasion and your needs, we will make it look the best your price can be.</p>
