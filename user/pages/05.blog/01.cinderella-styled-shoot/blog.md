With the new Disney Live Action Cinderella Movie, Kasper Creations Photography thought would be great to do a Cinderella Wedding Styled Shoot. There were so many great vendors that participated and we loved how it turned.

The chandelier earrings studded with gems really added some sparkle. Even a bracelet and mask to complete the look. Mirrorball slippers, not glass but they sparkel oh so well.

The dress was so stunning. Soft and delicate with so many layers of tulle.
